This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

System Design Involved ðŸ¤”?
I would say Yes!. Not that much advanced but the concepts required for a succesfull web service

1) Microservices Architecture:
Divide the application into smaller services like user management, profile management, and content delivery. This makes the application modular, scalable, and easy to maintain.

2) Caching:
Use caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data like user profiles. This reduces the load on the database and improves response times.

3) Lazy and eager loading for Images

4) Asynchronous Processing
